If you want me to do math problems, you have to say solve a math problem. After that, just enter your math problem that has ONLY one symbol! After I do problems, I will ask you do you want me to do another problem or something along those lines. If you want me to do more problems, just say something that means yes. I can also set timers in many forms; hours, minutes, and seconds! I also have a variety of games that you can play with me! When I ask what problems do you have for me, just say play a game. I can play 3 games; rock paper scissors, number guessing game, and tic tac toe (this requires a pencil and paper)! I can also say random numbers, letters, and colors! I also have a special pronunciation ability that will help you pronounce hard words. I can also give the date/time and much more! Enjoy using me!";
